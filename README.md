  ## Description
  This project uses the MERN stack to allow users to search for books via Google. This app allows users to create an account so that they can not only search for books, but also save selected books to come back and view later. 
  
  ## Usage
  Users can visited the deployed application and simply search for a book. Users can also create and account by signing up using a screenname, email, and password. Then, users can log in and not only search books, but save them to their own collection. A user can use this to keep track of what books they wish to read, and if desired can delete books from their list after reading them.
